# Car Parking Simulator

<h1>A car parking simulator which consisted of C/C++ programmed on a Linux Embedded Environment</h1>

<p>Sometimes you drive into your garage and you don't really know if you have enough room to open your door, hit the front of your garage, or not parked in enough, but worry not! This simulator will provide you with an ideal idea of where to park next time because it will allow for a remote controlled car to drive into the garage and provide user feedback. The feedback consists of an LED blinking to allow the driver know if they are in a good position, an email of their statistics of how many successful parks, where their exact distance is from all 4 dimensions, and a buzzer to let the driver know if they hit a wall or not. This project consisted of hardware and software concepts on a Linux Embedded environment that provided a real life simulation of parking a car.</p>

<h3>Implemented software concepts such as:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Cross compiling C/C++ files in order to run on the Onion Linux Embedded Environment</li>
  <li>Various C libraries including ugpio and fstream</li>
  <li>Read in distance sensor data and stored them into struct data structures to perform statistics</li>
  <li>File logged events that occured and errors</li>
</ul>
  
 
  
<h3>Implemented hardware concepts such as:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Onion Linux Embedded Envrinment microcontroller</li>
  <li>Arduino and Arduino Ultrasonic sensors</li>
</ul>
